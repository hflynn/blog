layout: post

Then merrily add some text using markdown e.g *this is italics*, **this is bold** and a link is formatted as [link text](http://yourlinkhere.html)

If you want titles within a post, headings are

# Top level

## Subtitle

### Another another level if needed

To add an image, save it into the image folder and then insert using
![alt text](/images/yourimage.png)

See a markdown guide such as [this one here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
if you need further formatting help. The markdown engine for GitHub pages is
now kramdown, a [quick reference guide is available](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

Or see [poole example content file](https://github.com/poole/poole/blob/master/_posts/2014-01-01-example-content.md)
for what types of more technical formatting are supported by this theme.
